## 2026-04-15 - Added aria-labels to icon-only buttons
**Learning:** The UI extensively uses lucide-react icons within buttons without accessible text labels, presenting a systematic accessibility gap.
**Action:** Ensure all icon-only interactive elements receive descriptive `aria-label` attributes to support screen readers and keyboard navigation users.

## 2026-04-16 - Added loading state to async submit button
**Learning:** Users need immediate visual feedback when initiating long-running tasks. Disabling the button is good, but adding a spinner and updating the text confirms the action was received and the application is actively processing.
**Action:** Always include a loading spinner or active state text on primary action buttons that trigger async operations.
## 2024-04-21 - Added missing ARIA labels to icon-only interactive elements
**Learning:** Discovered icon-only buttons in the VideoResult component lacking `aria-label` and `title` attributes, which creates an inaccessible experience for screen reader users and those seeking tooltip context.
**Action:** Implemented `aria-label` and `title` properties on "Set active keyframe", "Apply Reference Guidance", and "Download image" buttons to improve screen reader accessibility and discoverability.

## 2026-04-23 - [Add ARIA properties to image toggle buttons]
**Learning:** Image-only buttons used for toggling states (like selecting guidance frames) are completely opaque to screen readers without proper aria-labels and aria-pressed attributes. Relying on visual borders to indicate selection state is a severe accessibility anti-pattern.
**Action:** Always add `aria-label` (using the image's name/context), `aria-pressed` (reflecting the boolean selected state), and `alt` text to the inner image for interactive image galleries/pickers.
## 2026-05-02 - Keyboard Accessibility for Hover-Revealed Elements
**Learning:** Buttons inside elements with `opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100` are unreachable by keyboard users because they remain visually hidden when focused. Similarly, file inputs with `className="hidden"` are completely removed from the accessibility tree and cannot receive focus.
**Action:** Use `focus-visible:opacity-100` on the buttons, or `focus-within:opacity-100` on parent elements, to ensure they appear when focused via keyboard. For file inputs, use Tailwind's `sr-only` class instead of `hidden` so they remain focusable, and apply `focus-within` styling to their parent labels.

## 2026-05-15 - Context-Aware Confirmation Dialog Buttons
**Learning:** Hardcoded button text in reusable components (like ConfirmDialog always saying "Start New Project") creates extremely confusing UX when the dialog is repurposed for other actions like "Reset Application" or "Approve Cost". In addition, destructive actions lack visual distinction from standard actions.
**Action:** Always provide props to customize button text (`confirmText`, `cancelText`) in reusable dialogs, and use an `isDestructive` boolean prop to alter the primary action styling (e.g. red background, red icon) when the confirmation will delete data or incur costs. Ensure proper `role="dialog"` and `aria-labelledby`/`aria-describedby` are included for accessibility.

## 2026-05-18 - Missing Icons in Primary Action Bars
**Learning:** Inconsistent visual hierarchy in primary action bars (where some buttons have icons and others don't) can disrupt scanning and make features like 'Export ZIP Package' feel disconnected from adjacent actions like 'Download All Images'.
**Action:** Ensure sibling actions in primary toolbars share a consistent visual treatment, including the presence of an icon and flex alignment, to maintain a cohesive and intuitive interface.
